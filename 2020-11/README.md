### Covid-19 infection trend in Guatemala

The trend of infections is carried out through two perspectives: one having 30 days of information on infections in Guatemala at the beginning of the pandemic and the trend will be shown at different times.

The first execution was configured to predict infections at 50 days, the official number was 644 infected, although later the Guatemalan Ministry of Health corrected the number of infections by increasing them. So the prediction is approximately correct.

The second execution is made for 200 days, according to official data there were 90,968 infected, which indicates that the prediction is correct.

As of November, Guatemala is reducing the number of infections, so the prediction may vary. However, depending on what is happening in Europe there could be a second wave of infections in December, adjustments would have to be made to the model so that the prediction remains correct.

For the department of Guatemala, it is projected that by the end of November, the curve of confirmed cases will decrease.

In the case of Costa Rica, it had a different behavior since the growth curve of the infected behaved rather in the way of a polynomial of degree 4, that is, it can stabilize and begin a decline.

According to the graph, it is observed that indeed, in the next 50 days, the advance of the infected will begin to decline and this is encouraging for the neighboring country.

### Projection of deaths for Guatemala from COVID-19 until December 2020

It seeks to make a projection using the sklearn library on the number of deaths that covid-19 can cause at the end of 2020.
